            <h4> Become A Web Developer </h4>
            <p> I am Ekwedike Chidiebere Damian and I am undergoing training to become a web developer. I have been teaching myself and so far, I am doing well. I have been able to teach myself everything on HTML5 and CSS. I am still learning though. I know I will get better at what I do </p>

            <p> I am a bad coder for now but slowly and steadily, I am making progress. Though the process is tedious and outrightly discouraging, it has a certain lullaby in its arm. Its like soothing medicine </p>

            <p> I am my own version of Aladin. I didn't get a quest to enter a forbidden cave nor did I get a magic lamp, nor even a Genie. Literally speaking, I am an Aladin- a niggie that knows what he wants to become and is fully working towards it. </p>
